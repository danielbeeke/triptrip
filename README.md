# TripTrip

A website to visualize your vacation trips with. You select a folder and the website will process all the files.
It will group and sort the photos, videos and gpx files.

From those files it will create journal pages. A journal page is typically group around a gpx or a day.
The intent is to create this in a modular way so that it may work for different usecases too.
